      <h2>Elements and Structure Notes</h2>
      <ul class='notes'>
        <li><strong>Element Content</strong> - the content of an HTML element is the information between the opening and closing tags of an element.</li>
        <li><strong>HTML Structure</strong> - HTML is organized into a <strong>family tree</strong> structure. HTML can have parents, grandparents, siblings, children, grandchildren, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Attribute Name and Values</strong> - HTML attributes consist of a name and a value using the following syntax: name='value' and can be added to the opening tag of an HTML element to configure or change the behaviour of the element.</li>
        <li><strong>Whitespace</strong> - Whitespace, such as line breaks, added to an HTML document between block-level elements will generally be ignored b the browserand are not added to increase spacing on the rendered HTML page. It is just added for <strong>organization an easier reading</strong> of the HTML document.</li>
        <li><strong>File Path</strong> - URL paths in HTML can be <strong>absolute</strong> paths, like a full URL, e.g. https://developer.mozilla.ord/en-US/docs/Learn or a <strong>relative</strong> file path that links to a local file in the same folder or on the same server, e.g. ./style.css. Relative file paths begin with <strong>./</strong> followed by a path to the local file. ./ tells the browser to look for the file path from the current folder.</li>
        <li><strong>HTML Element</strong> - A piece of content in an HTML document and uses the following syntax: opening tag + content + closing tag.</li>
        <li><strong>HTML Tag</strong> - The syntax for a single HTML tag is an opening angle bracket &lt; followed by the element name and a closing angle bracket &gt;.</li> 
        <li><strong>Indentation</strong> - Should be formatted so that the indentation level of text increases once for each level of nesting. You can use 2 to 4 spaces per level of nesting.</li>
        <li><strong>Link to a Different Part of the Page #</strong> - The anchor element 7lt;a&gt; can create hyperlinks to <strong>different parts</strong> of the same HTML document using the href attribute to point to the desired location with # followed by thr id of the element to link to.</li>
        <li><strong>Comments</strong> - Can be added between an opening &lt;!-- and closing --&gt;. Content inside of comments will not be rendered by browsers and are usually used to <strong>describe</strong> a part of code or provide other details. Comments can span single or multiple lines.</li>

      <h2>CSS - Anatomy, Selectors and Specificity Notes</h2>
        <ul class='notes'>
          <li><strong>Purpose of CSS</strong> - A language that is used in combination with HTML that customizes how HTML elements will appear. CSS can define <strong>styles</strong> and change the <strong>layout</strong> and <strong>design</strong> of a sheet.</li>
          <li><strong>CSS Declarations</strong> - The key-value pair of a CSS property and its value. They are used to set style properties and construct rules to apply to individual or groups of elements. The property name and value are separated by a colon and the entire declaration must be terminated by a semi-colon.</li>
          <li><strong>Rule Sets</strong> - Contains one or more selectors and one or more declarations. The rule set is the main building block of a CSS sheet.</li>
          <li><strong>Resource URLs</strong> - Used to wrap the resource URLs. These can be applied to several properties such as background-image.</li>
          <li><strong>!important Rule</strong> - Used on declarations to override any other declarations for a property and ignore selector specificity. Ensures that a specific declaration always applies to the matched elements. Avoid using it because it is very hard to override.</li>
          <li><strong>Link Element</strong> - Used to link HTML documents to <strong>external resources</strong> like CSS files. It commonly uses: href - specifies the URL to the external resource, rel - specifies the relationship of the linked document to the current document and type - defines the type of content being linked.</li>
          <li><strong>Write CSS in Separate Files</strong> - CSS can be written in its own files to keep it separate from the HTML code. The extension for these files is .css. They can be linked to an HTML file using a &lt;link&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt; section.</li>
          <li><strong>Write CSS in HTML File</strong> - Can be written in an HTML file by enclosing the code in &lt;style&gt; tags. Code surrounded by these tags will be interpreted as CSS syntax.</li>
          <li><strong>Inline Styles</strong> - CSS styles can be directly added to HTML elements by using the <strong>style</strong> attribute in the element's opening tag. Each style declaration is ended with a semicolon.</li>
          <li><strong>Groups of CSS Selectors</strong> - Match <strong>multiple</strong> selectors to the <strong>same</strong> CSS rule, using a <strong>comma-separated list</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Selector Chaining</strong> - Defines the set of elements to which a CSS rule set applies.</li>
          <li><strong>Chaining Selectors</strong> - Sometimes in CSS, 2 or more CSS selectors are required at the same time. You can combine multiple selectors by chaining.</li>
          <li><strong>Descendant Combinator</strong> - Elements that are nested within HTML elements, known as <strong>descendants</strong>. Makes selectors even more specific by making sure they appear in the context we expect.</li>
          <li><strong>Specificity</strong> - Adding more than one tag, class or ID to a CSS selector increases the specificity of the CSS selector.</li>

It works by <strong>recording the changes made to a project, storing those changes, then allowing a programmer to reference them as needed. All Git commands follow the pattern git &lt;git action&gt; and in order to use Git for a project, it must be first initialized using the git init command in the project's root directory.</li>
